# Current-Emerging-Trends

# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

For this course I was tasked with completing a treasure hunt game where the player had to find the treasure befroe the AI pirate did. In the game I had to implement a deep Q-Learning algorithm in order for the intelligent agent to find the shortest route to the treasure. For the project I was given the setup code which includes the GameExperience.py and TreasureMaze.py

# Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

- What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists design, develop, and analyze the software and hardware used to solve problems in many differetn areas of life. They are aslo tasked with ensuring the effectiveness of many computer based systems. The job of a computer scientist is very important as they play a critical role in helping to revolutionze many of today industries such as, healthcare and education, through the development of various software systems.

- How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
As a computer scientis I approach many of my problems by first breaking them down and ensuring that I understand the problem. Next I ensure that I understand any constrainsts associated with the problem. Then I begin to brainstorm for a solution to the problem using any resourcs that are at my disposal. Lastly, I implement and and test the solution to ensure that it effectively solves the problem at hand. 

- What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
As a computer scientists my eithical responsibilities include ensuring that the work being completed does no harm to the public or the organization. I am also reponsible for ensuring that personal privacy of the end user is respected and protected and that projects are being completed with out persona bias.
